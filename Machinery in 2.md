# Composite materials in ship design

In ship design, wood remained the choice of material till the mid 19th century. Materials like cedar wood and teak were prized for their **hydrodynamic** properties(they usually contain chemicals that prevent rot, especially in freshwater environments). However, wood came with its own problems. In the presence of a wave of $\lambda$ similar to the ship and the ship is at the trough of the wave, "sagging" can take place. Also, if the bow or the stern are less buoyant than the center of the ship, "hogging" can occur. These problems were mostly mitigated when composite ship (wooden planking over a wrought iron frame)construction was introduced.

The part of the ship that undergoes the most stress during docking and turbulence is the hull of the ship. The hull is the watertight body of the ship, above which lies the superstructure.

The advantages of composite materials in ships can be summarised as follows:-
- They typically exhibit higher stiffness than most other materials, even steel and aluminium.
- These properties, however, are exhibited at much lower weights, which results in large improvements in top speeds.
- This lower weight also results in much lower fuel consumption costs(potentially thousands of gallons)
- Lower weight is useful especially in the design of the ship's superstructure( the part of a ship above the 'deck'). Due to lower torque at the top, the ship exhibits higher roll stability. Although boats are designed to sustain a certain amount of roll without capsizing, a strong enough force against a top-heavy structure will cause it to capsize.
- Yet another reason to use composites is their non corrosive properties, especially in seawater.
- When boats are tested for impact resistance (that can reduce damage, say when it crashes into a pier/dock), the strength of the adhesive becomes a much more important than the polymer sheaths it  is holding together

A significant amount of research has been pursued by the University of Mississippi, funded by the US Navy. The declassified report is linked in the acknowledgements.

The Navy experimented on various low-cost fire-resistant materials including graphite reinforced glass/carbon polymeric based composites with fly ash and 3-D fiber reinforced foams. They were evaluvated on the basis of their response to low velocity impact, ballistic, shock and blast loads etc.

### Sandwich Composites

Sandwich Composites of balsa wood( a traditional core material in ships ), with a PVC foam core. TYCOR from Webcore technologies is an engineered three-dimensional fiber reinforced damage tolerant  core for sandwich structures, has the potential to provide improved blast and ballistic resistance. In this core, glass fiber is reinforced through the thickness of closed cell foam sheets to produce a web and truss structure. When tested with Corning and Maniville glass fibres, Corning glass performed well in terms of Tensile Strength. However, we lose out in Shear Strength and are middle of the pack in Flexural Rigidity

### Nano Reinforced Composites

Graphite nanoplatelets( a type of nanoparticle made from graphite) interact with macro reinforcing fibres and polymer matrices, improving the mechanical properties and the durability of the composite.

When 2.5% nanoclay and exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets were added to pure vinyl ester, the work to rupture (i.e the energy needed to break the composite) almost doubles.

### Blast Load Simulations

### Conclusion
The short-term goal of testing composites for the shipbuilding industry is to design a light-weight, robust, low cost seaworthy vessel that wonâ€™t capsize or corrode prematurely increasing maintenance costs. The long-term objective is to gain data that will become instrumental in refining and improving ship designs.
